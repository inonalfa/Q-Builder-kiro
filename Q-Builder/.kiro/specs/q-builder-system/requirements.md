# Requirements Document

## Introduction

Q-Builder is a comprehensive web application designed for construction professionals and contractors in Israel. The system provides a unified platform for managing price quotes, projects, clients, and payments in one place. The application aims to streamline the work of contractors and professionals, save time, prevent errors, and enable organized tracking of client work.

The system will enable the generation of professional documents (such as PDF price quotes with logos and business details) and provide full support for Hebrew and right-to-left (RTL) direction. Development will be carried out using modern technologies: React with Vite for the client-side, Zustand for state management, Tailwind CSS for UI design, and a REST API server with a relational SQL database.
