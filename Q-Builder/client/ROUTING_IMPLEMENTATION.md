# Frontend Routing Implementation Summary

## Task 7.4: Implement frontend routing and navigation

### ✅ Completed Components

#### 1. Route Guards
- **ProtectedRoute.tsx** - Guards authenticated routes, redirects to login if not authenticated
- **PublicRoute.tsx** - Prevents authenticated users from accessing auth pages

#### 2. Main Router
- **AppRouter.tsx** - Main routing configuration with:
  - Public routes: `/login`, `/auth/callback`
  - Protected routes with Layout wrapper:
    - `/` → redirects to `/dashboard`
    - `/dashboard` → Dashboard component
    - `/quotes` → Quotes management (placeholder)
    - `/quotes/new` → New quote form (placeholder)
    - `/quotes/:id` → Quote details (placeholder)
    - `/quotes/:id/edit` → Edit quote (placeholder)
    - `/projects` → Projects management (placeholder)
    - `/projects/:id` → Project details (placeholder)
    - `/clients` → Clients management (placeholder)
    - `/clients/new` → New client form (placeholder)
    - `/clients/:id` → Client details (placeholder)
    - `/clients/:id/edit` → Edit client (placeholder)
    - `/profile` → Business profile (placeholder)
  - Fallback route handling

#### 3. Navigation Components
- **Breadcrumb.tsx** - Dynamic breadcrumb navigation with:
  - Automatic breadcrumb generation based on current route
  - Support for dynamic routes (with IDs)
  - Hebrew labels for all pages
  - Proper RTL layout

#### 4. Page Title Management
- **usePageTitle.ts** - Hook for managing document titles:
  - Automatic title updates based on current route
  - Support for dynamic routes
  - Hebrew page titles
  - Format: "Page Title | Q-Builder"

#### 5. Layout Integration
- **Layout.tsx** updated to include:
  - Breadcrumb component
  - Page title hook
  - Proper outlet for nested routes

#### 6. Navigation Updates
- **Sidebar.tsx** updated to:
  - Remove blocking notifications for implemented routes
  - Close sidebar on mobile after navigation
  - Added profile menu item
  - Proper active state handling

- **Header.tsx** updated to:
  - Navigate to profile page from user menu
  - Navigate to login after logout
  - Proper navigation integration

- **Dashboard.tsx** updated to:
  - Navigate to appropriate pages from quick actions
  - Proper routing for new quote, add client, view projects

#### 7. App Integration
- **App.tsx** updated to use AppRouter instead of design example
- **components/index.ts** updated to export routing components

### 🔧 Route Structure

```
/                     → Redirect to /dashboard
/login               → Login page (public)
/auth/callback       → OAuth callback (public)
/dashboard           → Main dashboard (protected)
/quotes              → Quotes list (protected)
/quotes/new          → New quote form (protected)
/quotes/:id          → Quote details (protected)
/quotes/:id/edit     → Edit quote (protected)
/projects            → Projects list (protected)
/projects/:id        → Project details (protected)
/clients             → Clients list (protected)
/clients/new         → New client form (protected)
/clients/:id         → Client details (protected)
/clients/:id/edit    → Edit client (protected)
/profile             → Business profile (protected)
```

### 🛡️ Authentication Flow

1. **Unauthenticated users** → Redirected to `/login`
2. **Authenticated users accessing auth pages** → Redirected to `/dashboard`
3. **Protected routes** → Require authentication, show loading during auth check
4. **Route state preservation** → Login redirects back to intended page

### 🧭 Navigation Features

1. **Breadcrumb Navigation**
   - Automatic generation based on current route
   - Hebrew labels with proper RTL layout
   - Clickable navigation links
   - Hidden on single-level pages

2. **Page Titles**
   - Dynamic document title updates
   - Hebrew page titles
   - Consistent format with app branding

3. **Sidebar Navigation**
   - Active state highlighting
   - Mobile-responsive with overlay
   - Badge support for notifications
   - Proper navigation without blocking

4. **Header Navigation**
   - User menu with profile access
   - Logout with redirect to login
   - Mobile hamburger menu

### 📱 Mobile Responsiveness

- Sidebar collapses on mobile with overlay
- Hamburger menu in header for mobile
- Touch-friendly navigation elements
- Proper RTL layout on all screen sizes

### 🔄 State Management Integration

- Uses existing Zustand stores (authStore, uiStore)
- Preserves authentication state across navigation
- Proper loading states during route transitions
- Notification system integration

### ✅ Requirements Fulfilled

- ✅ React Router with protected routes for authenticated users
- ✅ Route guards for authentication and authorization  
- ✅ Proper navigation between dashboard, quotes, projects, clients
- ✅ Breadcrumb navigation and page titles
- ✅ Connected existing layout components to routing system
- ✅ Updated App.tsx to use proper routing instead of design example

### 🚀 Ready for Implementation

The routing system is now fully implemented and ready for use. All placeholder components can be replaced with actual functionality as other tasks are completed. The routing foundation supports:

- Scalable route structure
- Proper authentication flow
- Mobile-responsive navigation
- Hebrew/RTL support
- Integration with existing state management
- Error boundary protection
- Loading states and transitions
