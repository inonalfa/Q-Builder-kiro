   function App() {
     return <AppleDesignExample />;
   }
   ```

2. **For Full Application** (when backend is ready):
   ```tsx
   // src/App.tsx - Uncomment this code when ready
   import { BrowserRouter as Router, Routes, Route } from 'react-router-dom';
   import Layout from './components/layout/Layout';
   import Dashboard from './pages/dashboard/Dashboard';
   // ... other imports
   
   function App() {

           <Route path="/" element={<Layout />}>
             <Route index element={<Dashboard />} />
             {/* Other routes */}
