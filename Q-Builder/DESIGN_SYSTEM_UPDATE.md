## Files Updated
1. `.kiro/specs/q-builder-system/design.md` - Comprehensive design system documentation
2. `client/src/styles/README.md` - Updated component documentation
3. `README.md` - Added design system overview section
4. `client/tailwind.config.js` - Already aligned with design system (no changes needed)
5. `client/src/styles/apple-design.css` - Already implements the design system

## Next Steps
The design system is now fully documented and ready for implementation. The existing CSS and Tailwind configuration already align with the documented specifications, providing a solid foundation for building the Q-Builder interface with consistent Apple-inspired design patterns.

## Benefits
- **Consistency**: Unified design language across all components
